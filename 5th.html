    <center><h1>DESCRIPTION LIST OF FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1></center>
    <dl>
        <dt>Front-end Frameworks</dt>
        <dd>
            Front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js are used to build the user interface (UI) and handle
            user interactions in web applications. They allow developers to create dynamic and responsive web pages.
        </dd>

        <dt>Back-end Frameworks</dt>
        <dd>
            Back-end frameworks such as Express.js (Node.js), Ruby on Rails, or Django provide the server-side logic for
            web applications. They handle data processing, authentication, and serve as the backbone of the application.
        </dd>

        <dt>Database Management Systems (DBMS)</dt>
        <dd>
            DBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB are used to store, manage, and retrieve data for web applications.
            They ensure data integrity and provide efficient data access.
        </dd>

        <dt>Version Control</dt>
        <dd>
            Version control systems like Git help developers track and manage changes to the source code, collaborate
            with other team members, and maintain a history of code revisions.
        </dd>

        <dt>Front-end Markup and Styling</dt>
        <dd>
            HTML and CSS are fundamental technologies for creating the structure and styling of web pages. CSS
            preprocessors like SASS or LESS enhance CSS functionality.
        </dd>

        <dt>Server-side Programming Languages</dt>
        <dd>
            Server-side programming languages like JavaScript (Node.js), Python, Ruby, or Java are used to build the
            server-side logic of web applications.
        </dd>

        <dt>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</dt>
        <dd>
            APIs allow different software components to communicate and interact. RESTful or GraphQL APIs enable data
            exchange between the front-end and back-end.
        </dd>

        <dt>Deployment and Hosting</dt>
        <dd>
            Services like AWS, Heroku, or Azure are used to deploy web applications, making them accessible to users
            over the internet.
        </dd>
    </dl>
